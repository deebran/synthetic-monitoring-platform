# Synthetic Monitoring Platform

A Python-based **synthetic monitoring platform** that periodically runs `ping` commands, stores metrics in **Prometheus**, and visualizes them in **Grafana** for real-time network performance insights.

This project was built as part of the Build Fellowship program and emphasizes **DevOps**, **observability**, and **site reliability engineering** concepts.

## üìñ About
I built this platform as part of the **Build Fellowship program**, where I took upon the role of a Software Developer under the guidance of an experienced Build Fellow (Sonu Gupta).  

The project simulates the operations of a real software development team and focuses on **DevOps** and **observability** practices. We developed a **synthetic monitoring platform** in Python that uses `ping` to measure network performance, exports the results to **Prometheus**, and visualizes them in **Grafana**.  

This hands-on project helped me gain industry-relevant experience with:
- Writing Python monitors for early problem detection.  
- Configuring Prometheus and creating PromQL queries.  
- Building Grafana dashboards for real-time observability.  
- Applying concepts of synthetic monitoring, site reliability engineering (SRE), and troubleshooting distributed apps.
